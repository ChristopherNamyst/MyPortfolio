<div class="aboutMe" id="aboutChris">
    <p>My name is Christopher, and I am a mixed-media artist and web developer with a passion for design. Born and raised in Chicago, and after spending several years in Los Angeles, I now call Detroit my home. It has been a wonderful experience thus far and I hope to further my career in development among the thousands of other awe-inspired tech guru's that call Detroit home. <br>I hope to integrate my experience as a music producer, graphic artist and web developer to become a well rounded designer that can meet any clients needs. <br>If you have a project in mind, please drop me a line. I will personally respond and see if we are a good fit for each other. I hope to hear from you soon!
    Namaste!</p>
